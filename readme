#### Project Task : Finding similar items

The task is to implement a detector of pairs of similar book reviews.

Here we implemented a structured flow to process similar reviews.  
We worked throught the following steps:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing  
  a. Removing Null Reviews,  
  b. Genearting a Review_ID to use later on for reduced comparisons  
      (reveiw_id <- combination of book_id, user_id, review/time  
      (Creating a hash for it for memory efficiency)  
  c. Removing Very short reviews (<25 characters lenght),   
  d. Lemmatizing the Text Tokens for root words.  
  e. Removing common StopWords and words like book, read etc.  
2. Hashing the Lemmatized Tokens.  
3. Performing Locally Sensitive MinHashing.  
4. Applying Jaccard Similarity
5. Analysis of Similar Reviews

* Note: to run the code, you will need to uplaod your Kaggle API key file.
Further, you an toggle to run the code on full dataset of on different fractions of the sample (as we did).
